# book-search-engine

During this challenge, a lot of research went into learning how to implement GraphQL! Two things drive modern applications; data and user demands. this was utilizing Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, but will be refactored to use GraphQLs API. Apart from GraphQL, this application uses React.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Apollo Server. Being limited on time because of recent interviews, there's still more implementation needed to complete but showing progress step by step and how it comes together is always amazing to see.
